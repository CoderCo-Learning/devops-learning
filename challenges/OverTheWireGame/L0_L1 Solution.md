# Level 0 -> 1

The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.

## Solution

```
pwd
```
What is 'cat'? The cat command in Unix-like operating systems is short for "concatenate" and is used to display the contents of a file. When you run cat, it reads and prints the entire content of the file named readme to the terminal. This is useful for quickly viewing the contents of a file without opening it in a text editor.
```
cat readme
```
